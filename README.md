# Java Programming
The bunch of java source code which listed on the book I bought.

Each branch are contained a lot of code of each chapter question. This branch is contained Hello world.

The folder named with alphabets and numbers is contained the solution of question. Make you sure to know that.

### For someone who want to run the program
Download and install Azul zing community(a.k.a Zulu JDK) which compatible with your OS
(I used this JDK to programming. Of course, you can use Oracle JDK, Open JDK too, but I don't have any reponsibility about compatibility issues. Use at your own risks.)

After installing, clone or fork this repository.
For Windows: Run Git-bash and follow the instruction below.
For Other OS: Follow the instruction below.

`git clone "https://www.github.com/CiSJiK/javaprogramming/"` This will clone this repository with all of branches. Yes. You can just clone part of this repository to add branch name after `javaprogramming/`

After cloning, just compile all of the files through Intellij Idea or Eclipse, javac.

Then run this program through those program or java. In java, just run Main.class, `java Main`

Have fun with this repository and Hope to share your idea to me. This repository is not my property, is for ours.
